My name is Miika, I am a software engineer and a Linux/Unix enthusiast located in
Queens, New York. I particularly enjoy finding simple, efficient solutions and building
on the knowledge of the past to solve new problems.

I work as a software developer at [Wildpack Beverage](https://wildpackbev.com/). At
work, I use technology to improve and streamline manufacturing and business processes to
increase efficiency, reduce costs, and save time. I mostly work on
[Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/), an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, using a
technology stack of Python, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, XML, and Sass. I also automate and
improve DevOps processes by employing tools such as Docker, Ansible, and Bash scripting.

When I'm not in front of a screen, I enjoy lifting weights, being in nature, and going
to church.

## My Website Setup and Tools

The publishing method of my website has migrated from an
[automated bash script](https://github.com/miikanissi/blogi), to
[Emacs Org-mode](/blog/website-with-emacs/) to a
[Makefile based static website generator (mblog)](https://github.com/miikanissi/mblog)
and now to [Hugo](https://github.com/miikanissi/miikanissi.com) with my own
[custom theme](https://github.com/miikanissi/debet-esse). Throughout these changes my
goal has remained the same: to make a simple static blog website, no JavaScript, no
excessive CSS, but a distraction free place to share my ideas and guides on technology.

This meme by [@vincentdnl](https://twitter.com/vincentdnl) is an accurate depiction of
my thought process for this site:
