My name is Miika, I'm a software engineer and a Linux/UNIX enthusiast located in Queens,
New York City. I particularly enjoy learning new paradigms of programming languages and
finding simple, efficient solutions.

I work as a software engineer at [Tawasta](https://tawasta.fi/en/). My work revolves
around building open source business solutions for [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/),
enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, using a technology stack of Python,
JavaScript, PostgreSQL, XML, Sass, and Docker. I also help with Linux system
administration to ensure services are running smoothly.

When I'm not programming or working with computers, I enjoy lifting weights, working
with animals and being in nature.

## My Website

My website's publishing method has migrated from an
[automated bash script](https://github.com/miikanissi/blogi), to Emacs Org-mode to a
[Makefile based static website generator (mblog)](https://github.com/miikanissi/mblog)
and now to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with my own
[custom theme](https://github.com/miikanissi/debet-esse). Throughout these changes my
goal has remained the same: to make a simple static blog website, no JavaScript, no
excessive CSS, but a distraction free place to share my ideas and guides on technology.

my thought process for this site:
