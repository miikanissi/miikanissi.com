This simple Git guide is satire and not meant to offend anyone. If you are a dummy or a
beginner to using Git this might actually be helpful to you and work as a cheatsheet (I
sometimes visit this post when I forget a command).

### `git clone`

- Get my shit.

### `git push`

- Send my shit.

### `git add <filename>`

- Track my new shit.

### `git add --patch`

- Let me choose the new shit to track.

### `git commit`

- This shit is good for now.

### `git pull`

- Get the new shit.

### `git checkout -b <branch name>`

- I'm going to work on my shit over here for now.

### `git checkout <branch name>`

- I'm going back to this shit.

### `git merge <branch name>`

- Mix that shit with this shit.

### `git checkout --theirs`

- That shit is better than this shit, fuck this.

### `git checkout --ours`

- This shit is better than that shit, fuck that.

### `git commit --amend`

- I need to fix my shit.

### `git log`

- Let's look at this shit.

### `git status`

- I need to know my shit.

### `git rm <filename>`

- I don't need this shit.

### `git commit --fixup=<commit hash> (or --squash)`

- Here's some new shit to fix some old shit. I'll rebase it later.

### `git rebase -i [--autosquash] <old commit>`

- Are you dumb?
  1. No, Let's clean this shit up.
  2. Yes, Just fuck my shit up.

## That's It

Knowing how to use these Git commands is mostly all you need for a good Git workflow.
Happy programming.
