  "Reflecting on my experience with Full Stack Open Node.js and React course by
  University of Helsinki."
---

For my last class before graduation, I decided to take a
[Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course by
[University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en). The course serves as an
introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on
building single page applications with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) that use REST
APIs built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). There is also a section about
[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), a modern alternative to REST APIs.

The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for storing the applicationâ€™s data, too. There are
also additional parts on [Docker Containers](https://www.docker.com/),
[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and CI/CD.

The core curriculum consists of 5-14 ETCS credits of which I completed 13 credits (I
skipped part 13 - relational databases, since I have plenty of experience on the topic).
Each credit corresponds to roughly 27 hours of work totaling 351 hours for my 13
credits, however I ended up spending roughly 200 hours on the course.

## My experience

**I particularly enjoyed the practical aspect of the course** - it explained the best
practices of web development and introduced many helpful tools to ease the development
such as linters, npm packages and editor plugins. The course included parts on CI/CD and
Docker Containers which are tools to ease development and are practical technologies to
be accustomed to.

The class had a great natural progression and most exercises were building on top of
previous exercises, which meant there were a lot of refactoring and building additional
features on top of pre-existing features, which mimics the development process in the
real world.

A big portion of the course focused on writing tests using
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)/[React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)
to write **unit tests** and using [Cypress](https://cypress.io/) to write **E2E tests**.
This was my first time being introduced to E2E testing and I was surprised at how
advanced the process was - Cypress is a great testing framework.

I completed the 2021 version of the course in early 2022, which meant some of the
material was slightly outdated and used older versions of Node.js and React. In practice
this was only a small hurdle as most version changes were well documented and I could
find an answer with a quick Google search.

## Afterword

I would recommend the course to anyone with a solid programming background that has
little to no experience with React/Node.js and are interested in learning the stack.
Overall the course is one of the best free online courses on modern web development.
