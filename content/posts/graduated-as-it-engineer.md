  "Reflecting on my studies and celebrating graduation from HAMK University of Applied
  Sciences."

I started my Bachelor of Engineering program in Information and Communications
Technology at [HAMK Univeristy of Applied Sciences](https://www.hamk.fi/?lang=en) in
Fall 2018. As of April 14th, 2022, I am officially a graduated ICT Engineer. Despite the
title of an ICT Engineer my main focus in my studies has been programming and computer
science.

My time at HAMK was great. I went from a hobbyist programmer to a professional software
developer. I loved the flexibility of my studies as I had the opportunity to take
interesting classes from many of the best universities in Finland. I am especially
grateful of the opportunity of remote learning towards the end of my studies as I
relocated to New York City while also working a full-time job.

My degree program has only been a starting point in my journey of learning and has given
me great tools to keep improving and become a better software developer. As part of my
degree [I wrote a Bachelor's Thesis on Improving Event Management Implementation on Odoo
Business Management Software]({{< relref "bachelors-thesis.md" >}}), which can be found
online for free at
